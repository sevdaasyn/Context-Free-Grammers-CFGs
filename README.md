## Context Free Grammers CFGs
```
A random sentence generator implemented.
For this, a sample CFG rule set is provided in the Chomsky Normal Form(CNF). 
Using the grammar rules defined in a grammar file.
The format of the CFG rules is as follows:

#S -> NP VP
#Noun -> book

Every sentence begins with a root which is defined as follows:
ROOT S #ROOT -> S

Each nonterminal can have multiple expansions. For example, NP either can be ex-
panded as Det Noun or Det Adj Noun.

```
